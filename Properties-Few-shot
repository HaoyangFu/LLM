You are a scientist specializing in Fenton-like single-atom catalysis. Your task is to extract the structural and electronic properties of the single-atom catalyst described in the following text. Use the provided examples as a guide for the information to extract and the output format.

If a specific piece of information cannot be determined with certainty from the provided text, represent its value as "unknown" in the JSON output.

Output the result in JSON format.

Examples:

Example 1

Input Text:
"A Co-N-C catalyst was synthesized for Fenton-like degradation of pollutants. EXAFS analysis showed a Co-N4 coordination environment with an average Co-N bond length of 1.9 Å. The cobalt was found to be in a +2 oxidation state. The material has a Co loading of 1.5 wt% and DFT calculations suggest a trigonal pyramidal geometry for the Co-N4 sites."

Example 2

Input Text:
"A highly stable single-atom platinum catalyst supported on cerium oxide (Pt SA/CeO2) demonstrated excellent Fenton-like activity. The platinum loading was 0.25 wt%. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy revealed that each Pt atom is coordinated with four oxygen atoms from the CeO2 support, forming Pt-O4 sites. The average Pt-O bond length was determined to be 2.01 Å. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that the platinum atoms were predominantly in the +2 oxidation state, and the sites exhibit a square planar geometry."

Example 3

Input Text:
"We report a nickel single-atom electrocatalyst (Ni SAC) anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene (N-G), showing promise for electro-Fenton processes. While the precise metal loading could not be definitively quantified in this preliminary study, EXAFS analysis suggested a primary coordination environment of Ni-N3. The average Ni-N bond length was measured at 1.88 Å. DFT calculations, supported by valence band XPS, pointed towards a formal oxidation state of +1 for the nickel single atoms under operating conditions. The d-band center was calculated to be -1.5 eV relative to the Fermi level."

Example 4

Input Text:
"An Fe-based single-atom catalyst dispersed on sulfur and nitrogen co-doped carbon (Fe SA/SNC) was synthesized for enhanced Fenton-like catalysis. The Fe content was determined to be 0.8 at%. XAS studies indicated that Fe atoms are coordinated by three nitrogen atoms and one sulfur atom, forming an Fe-N3S1 configuration. The Fe-N bond lengths are approximately 2.0 Å, and the Fe-S bond length is 2.2 Å. Mössbauer spectroscopy confirmed Fe(III) as the dominant oxidation state. The catalyst also showed a significant Bader charge of +1.8e on the Fe centers according to theoretical calculations."
